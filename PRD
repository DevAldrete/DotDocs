Product Name: DotDocs
Purpose: Retrieve, store, and explain specific snippets from any documentation/tutorial/manual link in a minimal, atomic, and context-rich way.

1. Problem Statement
Developers waste time hunting through long documentation and tutorials for small, specific pieces of information. DotDocs solves this by:
Extracting only relevant atomic chunks.
Adding short, understandable explanations.
Making the retrieval process instant and context-aware.

2. Goals
MVP Goal: Given a link to documentation, retrieve specific, relevant snippets with explanations.
Preserve original context and link to source.
Build a searchable store of snippets.

3. Scope
In Scope (MVP):
URL ingestion for HTML docs and Markdown tutorials.
Automatic content parsing and chunking into atomic snippets.
Local storage of chunks with embeddings for semantic search.
Retrieval with snippet + short explanation + source link.
Out of Scope (MVP, but future features):
PDF parsing.
Multi-link ingestion in one batch.
Offline mode with full doc caching.
Browser extension and CLI.

4. User Stories
As a developer, I want to paste a doc link and have the system automatically break it into small, searchable snippets so I can find what I need faster.
As a learner, I want short explanations next to code snippets so I understand what’s happening without reading the whole doc.
As a researcher, I want to search across multiple stored documents so I can reuse past knowledge.

5. Functional Specs
URL Ingestion Module
Input: Valid doc/tutorial/manual URL.
Process: Fetch → Clean → Parse → Chunk → Store.

Chunking Engine
Split into atomic “knowledge cards” with:
  Title / Section Name
  Code or text snippet
  Short description
  Original URL

Search Engine
Keyword & semantic search.
Return best match snippet with explanation.

Explanation Layer
Use LLM to generate a 2–3 sentence explanation per snippet.

6. Technical Requirements
Node.js (TypeScript) or Python backend.
Parsing libraries: BeautifulSoup (HTML), pdfplumber (PDF in later version).
Vector database: ChromaDB or Pinecone.
LLM API for explanations (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency).
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS (optional for MVP, CLI is enough).

7. Success Metrics
Retrieval accuracy: ≥ 85% relevant snippet matches.
Explanation clarity: rated ≥ 4/5 by test users.
Ingestion speed: < 5 seconds for a medium-sized doc page.

8. Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP)
 Single URL ingestion (HTML/Markdown).
 Snippet chunking & storage with embeddings.
 CLI retrieval command with explanations.

Phase 2
 Multiple document ingestion.
 PDF support.
 Web UI.

Phase 3
 Offline mode with full doc caching.
 Browser extension.
 Export snippets in multiple formats
